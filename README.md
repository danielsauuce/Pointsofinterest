# PointsOfInterest Web Application

## 📌 Overview

**PointsOfInterest** is a full-stack web application that allows users to explore, review, and recommend tourist destinations such as cities, historical landmarks, restaurants, countryside areas, and more. This project was developed using:

- **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend REST API
- **SQLite** for data storage
- **React** for the frontend
- **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** for mapping functionality
- **AJAX** for dynamic frontend-backend communication
- **RESTer** for testing all API endpoints

The project supports authenticated users and provides a review and recommendation system for each point of interest (POI). Authentication and authorization were key components of this project, ensuring that only verified users could access certain functionality, and that user data is handled securely.
